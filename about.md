## About OSM India

The OpenStreetMap project is a volunteer run project to make a highly detailed street level map of the whole world. Neighbourhood explorers just like you set off on foot, cycles, horses and even hot air baloons to collect information about their surroundings which comes together as one giant living digital map made by everyone.
